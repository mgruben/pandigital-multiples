# pandigital-multiples 
Find the largest 1-to-9 pandigital number formed by concatenating products.

An n-digit number is pandigital if that number contains the digits 1 through n exactly once, in any order.  
* Ex. `321789654` is pandigital, since it contains `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9`, and is `9` digits.

If a 9-digit pandigital number results from the concatenation of an integer product with the set (1, 2, 3, ..., n), then that number is a pandigital multiple
* Ex. `192384576` is a pandigital multiple, since `192 × 1 = 192`, `192 × 2 = 384`, `192 × 3 = 576`, and `192` + `384` + `576` = `192384576`

This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 32](https://projecteuler.net/problem=38).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
